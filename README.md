# Deep-fakedetection
This project aims to detect deepfakes to prevent the spread of misinformation. By identifying manipulated content, users can better distinguish between real and fake information online.



The project focuses on addressing AI-driven threats, particularly the detection of deepfake images, videos, and audio circulating as real news. Our goal is to develop techniques for reliably identifying manipulated media and ensuring the integrity of online information.
